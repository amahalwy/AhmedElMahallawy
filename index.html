					<h2>My Story</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I'm a software engineer in the Toronto area with broad experience in building applications 
					cross-stack using React/JavaScript on the front-end and various back-end technologies like 
					Ruby on Rails or Node/Express. I'm most interested in coding on both client and server side to
					create good clean code that is scalable, easily understood, and completely reusable:
					my passion is to build full-stack applications used as tools to help people with their day-to-day
					activities. As a child, you could always find me playing with Lego or Mechano the majority of my 
					time at home, looking to build the next thing; with an engineer’s mindset from a young age, I’ve found 
					great benefit incorporating technology in my life and strive to make that same difference with others.

				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I studied Kinesiology at University of Toronto near my home city where I learnt all about the human body
					and how it functions; I’m the kind of person who remains dedicated and strives to learn new things daily. 
					Prior to my bootcamp, I began learning Ruby on Rails to better prepare myself for the strenuous 4 months 
					to come in a very fast paced environment with little to no time to breathe. With that course under my belt,
					I exceeded all expectations for that section of the course and was able to get a firm grasp on Rails technology.
					I'm always keen to give 110% in everything I do as I’m a firm believer in anything less than 100% is being 
					dishonest to oneself.
